# Getting and Cleaning Data:  Course Project
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Each student will be required to submit:
  1) a tidy data set as described below, 
  2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
  3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that the student performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
Students should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
